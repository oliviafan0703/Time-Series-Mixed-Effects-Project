# Time-Series-Mixed-Effects-Project
Senior capstone time series/mixed effects project on movie box office/VSM stock price analysis

The aim of this multifaceted study is three-fold, which contains three inextricably intertwined complex objectives. First, we would like to analyze factors that predict movie box office. Secondly, we would like to analyze factors that predict virtual market stock prices. Finally, we would also like to assess whether virtual markets are efficient predictors of new product success, with manifestation in box office. On top of this hierarchy of research questions, the nature of this time series data set lends itself to diverse methods such as the ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model, exponential smoothing, etc. The two sets of predictor variables of interest are (1) movie budget, genre, distributor, release date, number of theaters, MPAA rating, (2) trading volume, total volume held long, total volume held short, and IPO date. The response variables are domestic, international and worldwide box office, and stock price of the 9380 movies.
