abstract = {Defining effective methods for determining consumer preferences for products prior to their launch has been a mainstay of marketing and management literature for decades. Virtual Stock Markets (VSMs) is an emerging method in new product forecasting that has been shown to produce reliable new product sales estimates by combining individual preferences via market-based aggregation mechanisms. Due to the emerging popularity of VSMs among practitioners, this cross-disciplinary study (combining insights from finance, marketing, and new product development fields) uses the example of the Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) and examines its predictive validity and potential systematic biases in its predictions to help think about the general applicability of these forecasting methods to other product areas, or how forecasts in other product areas may need to be modified to be more precise. This study finds evidence of overestimating the sales potential associated with products on the low end of the revenue expectation spectrum, which could be linked to the fact that in artificial exchanges, where no money changes hands, people tend to gamble hoping to make excessive returns. However, this explanation is weakened by the introduction of additional variables linked to the negative influence of information search costs (harder to utilize information is not fully reflected in the stock prices) and over-utilization of highly visible/conspicuous information. Practical implications for managers considering using VSMs for new product forecasting in creative gestalt-like settings are discussed.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting is one of the most widely used applications of data science. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of time series analysis and forecasting. It starts by pointing out the distinction between standard supervised predictive models and time series forecasting models. It provides an introduction to the different time series forecasting methods, starting with time series decomposition, data-driven moving averages, exponential smoothing, discusses model-driven forecasts including regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average methods, and machine learning-based methods using windowing techniques. The performance evaluation section provides a summary of key metrics to measure and compare the accuracy of the forecasting models. This chapter covers the implementation of forecasting techniques using RapidMiner and R.}

abstract = {Although numerous articles examine the effect on VAR forecasts from changes in the variables included in a model, little has been done to examine the effect that changing the lag structure has on forecasting accuracy. The latter analysis is made difficult by the fact that no overriding rule exists for ex ante selection of lag length in such models. This paper examines the sensitivity of forecasts from a VAR model using different lag structures. Holding constant the variables included and the time period studied, different lag structures are used. For example, we use simple ad hoc rules as well as statistical criteria, such as mean square error and Bayesian rules. Our results indicate that the accuracy of VAR forecasts varies dramatically across alternative lag structures. Moreover, our results show relatively short-lagged models to be more accurate, on average, than longer-lagged specifications.}
